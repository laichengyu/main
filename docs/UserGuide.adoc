== Introduction

CoinBook is a desktop application that is made for users who prefer to work on a mouse-free, command line platform with minimal [gloss]#<<gui,graphical user interface (GUI)>># dependence.

Coinbook allows you to store a portfolio of your cryptocurrency purchases as well as track the latest price trends and news, in addition to providing various
tools to simplify and expedite your management process such as profit calculation.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8. +
You can obtain the latest version [ext]#http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[here]# (Download JRE).
+
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` [exref]#link:{repoURL}/releases[here]#.
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your CoinBook.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. (Fig. 1)
+
.Startup Window
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type your commands in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all Coins
* *`buy`*`BTC 3` : adds 3 coins to the BTC account
* *`view`*`BTC` : view the details of the BTC account
* *`exit`* : exits the app

. Each command also has an associated [gloss]#<<alias,alias>># which are the same but shorter for faster input. For example:

* *`l`* : lists all Coins, equivalent to *`list`*

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command. Command aliases are specified after the `/` symbol.

[[Features]]
== Features

Every account action in _CoinBook_ can be done by typing some command, followed by its required and optional _parameters_ and pressing kbd:[Enter] to execute the action. Please check the boxes below for the conventions used in this guide to refer to command format.

Each command listing is usually followed by some examples on usage, with a description of the effect of each example below in the same order as displayed.

.Terminology
****
[[spec]]
* Specifier
** Refers to an account or group to perform the action upon
** This is used in commands requiring a target coin, and can be any one of the coin's:
*** INDEX: Its index number in the current coin listing
*** NAME: The name of the coin, e.g. `Bitcoin`, and is case-insensitive
*** CODE: The trading code of the coin, e.g. `BTC`
* Option/Parameter
** Refers to the additional information you must provide for the command
** These have a letter representing the option, followed by a slash (`/`), followed by the desired value
** The value is [underline]#underlined# and is the meaning of the option it follows (`[underline]##VALUE##` when used generally), e.g. `t/[underline]##TAG##` indicates the desired value of the tag should be typed after `t/`
****

.Command Format
****
* Command parts denoted in `UPPERCASE` should be supplied by the user
* Parts in square brackets are optional, e.g.
`SPECIFIER pass:[[]t/[underline]#TAG#]`
can be used as either `BTC t/fav` or `BTC`
* Parts with `...` after them can be used zero or more times, e.g. `pass:[[]t/[underline]#TAG#]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/cheap`, `t/active t/fav`, etc.
* If an option without `...` is used multiple times, only the rightmost value entered will be used
* Parameters can be in any order, e.g. if the command specifies `t/[underline]##TAG## a/[underline]##VALUE##`, then `a/[underline]##VALUE## t/[underline]##TAG##` is also acceptable
* Parts in curly braces indicate multiple possibilities, e.g. we use <<spec,`SPECIFIER`>> as shorthand for `{INDEX,NAME,CODE}`

f t/fav
find (p/>500 t/fav) OR h/<20

The condition query mostly follows the same format as that used in <<find,find>>, with additional options specified below. Also, `TAG` cannot be used as a notification condition.

.Notification Options Format
****
* Additional specifier `all` to refer to any account
* All `AMOUNT` s can be preceded with `+` or `-` to indicate a change in the detail specified instead of its absolute value, for example:
** `p/+1000`: Current price rose 1000

****

.Example
----
notify all h/>0
notify 1 w/>50
notify 3 w/+<1000
notify all p/->10%
----
* Notify when the amount held in an account is more than 0 after the update. This always triggers and is useless on its own but can be combined with other conditions to restrict notifications to a smaller set of accounts

* Notify when the amount worth in dollars of the third entry rises by more than 1000 dollars
* Notify when any coin's price falls more than 10%

.Examples
----
order p/a
order p/d n/d
----
* Sort the listing in ascending order based on current prices
* Sort the listing in descending order based on the current prices first, then if two coins have the same price, they will be sorted by name in reverse alphabetical order

[appendix]
== Glossary

[[alias]] Alias::
Alternate names for commands.

[[exponential-moving-average]] Exponential moving average::
A moving average window of closing prices over a past period that places more weight on the more recent days considered. Since cryptocurrencies do not have a closing price, this defaults to their price at 23:59:59 at the timezone of the exchange.

[[gui]] Graphical User Interface::
A type of user interface that lets users interact with the app through visual indicators, icons, mouse actions, etc. as compared to typed commands.

[[MACD]] Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)::
Moving Average Convergence Divergence is an indicator that is the difference between two moving averages.

[[macros]] Macros::
A set of commands that can be executed under a single custom command is a macro. For example, if a user wishes to only view coins of a specific tag in a certain sorted order, he can set create a custom macro (e.g. `sortfavourites`) such that upon entering it at a command, the program will internally first call the `search` command on the user set tags, then call the `sort` command.

[[resistance-lines]] Resistance Lines::
When the price of a coin has risen to a certain amount, the price may eventually sustain its value at this point for a period of time. This is when it obtains "resistance".

[[RSI]] Relative Strength Index::
Relative Strength Index is used as an indicator to compare the current strength of cryptocurrency versus its historical strength. The strength is calculated based on the closing prices over a period of time.

[[sensitive-data]] Sensitive Data::
Refers to data that is not meant to be shared with others.

[[simple-moving-average]] Simple Moving Average::
A moving average window of closing prices over a past period that places equal weight on all days considered. Since cryptocurrencies do not have a closing price, this defaults to their price at 23:59:59 at the timezone of the exchange.

[[support-lines]] Support lines::
When the price of a coin has fallen to a certain amount, the price may eventually sustain its value at this point for a period of time. This is when it obtains "support".
